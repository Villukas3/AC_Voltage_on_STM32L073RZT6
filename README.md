# AC_Voltage_on_STM32L073RZT6
This is a students project on STM32 microcontroller, that measures AC voltage

Uploaded files contain:
   * main.c file - here is the main code of the program
   * i2c_lcd.c and i2clcd.h - library and function files for 1602 LCD screen that was used to display results
   * Voltmeter.ioc - STM32CUBEMX file where UART, I2C, and ADC pins are configured
   * Voltmeter.rar - whole project file as I used it, I used cubeIDE for compiling the code
